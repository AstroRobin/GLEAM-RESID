# GLEAM-RESID
GLEAM REsidual Source IDentifier

This program is designed to IDentify REsidual Sources that were possibly missed in the initial GLEAM source identification selected from the WHITE frequency stacked (170-231MHz) images in IDR3. Such sources are believed to be very steep spectrum sources (alpha > 2) such that they could be detected at low frequencies images, yet fall below the detection threshold in the WHITE image frequency range.
